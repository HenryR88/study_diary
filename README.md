Study Diary is a web app that allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re studying and to make journal entries and add attachments as they learn about specific topics. 
The web app home page will describe the site and invite users to either register or log in. 
Once logged in, a user can create headings, make new learning records, read and edit existing entries.
